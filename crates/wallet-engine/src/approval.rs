//! Approval mode and approval handle types.
//!
//! The approval step is the critical human-in-the-loop gate in the
//! transaction pipeline. The `ApprovalMode` determines whether signing
//! is automatic or requires explicit operator confirmation.
//!
//! `ApprovalHandle` is a one-shot channel: the pipeline sends the handle to
//! the channel layer, which presents it to the operator, and the operator
//! responds via `ApprovalHandle::respond`. The pipeline awaits the response.
