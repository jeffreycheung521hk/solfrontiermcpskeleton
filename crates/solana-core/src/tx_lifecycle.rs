//! Transaction lifecycle state machine — pure, deterministic core.
//!
//! This module defines the canonical state machine for tracking Solana
//! transactions from submission through finality (or terminal failure).
//!
//! # Design invariants
//!
//! 1. **Monotonic progress** — state transitions only move forward in the
//!    precedence order. The system never regresses to a less-certain state.
//!
//! 2. **Terminal states are final** — `Finalized`, `Failed`, and `Expired`
//!    are permanent once reached. The single exception: `Expired` may be
//!    overridden by a later `Confirmed`/`Finalized` observation (defensive
//!    correction for RPC lag).
//!
//! 3. **Deterministic expiry** — a transaction expires ONLY when the network
//!    block height exceeds `lastValidBlockHeight`. Wall-clock timeouts are
//!    not used.
//!
//! 4. **No side effects** — all functions in this module are pure. No RPC
//!    calls, no async, no database access, no event emission. This is the
//!    core transition engine that all I/O layers depend on.
//!
//! # Precedence order (highest to lowest)
//!
//! ```text
//! Finalized > Failed > Confirmed > Dropped > Submitted
//! ```
//!
//! `Expired` is terminal but ranked below `Confirmed` — a transaction
//! observed on-chain always overrides a local expiry classification.
