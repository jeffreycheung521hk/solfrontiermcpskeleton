//! Approval request and decision types.
//!
//! An `ApprovalRequest` is issued by the pipeline when a transaction requires
//! human authorisation. It carries everything the operator needs to make an
//! informed decision. Once issued it is one-time-actionable: a second decision
//! on the same `request_id` is rejected.
//!
//! An `ApprovalDecision` is the operator's response. Approved decisions resume
//! the signing pipeline; rejected decisions are terminal for that request.
